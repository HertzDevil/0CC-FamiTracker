    during clean up
 - FDS instruments no longer set the "file is modified" flag upon editing if
    they use frequency modulation
 - N163 instruments no longer set the "file is modified" flag upon editing if
    there is more than one waveform

V0.2.2 - 12/03/14
Additions:
 - Ctrl+Shift+M now toggles Namco 163 multiplexer emulation, enabled by default
 - Namco 163 waveforms can be up to 128 samples long
Improvements:
 - Multichip FTMs load properly when there are fewer than 8 N163 channels
 - Instrument editor always moves the pattern editor cursor to one of the
    instrument's channel(s) whenever the cursor is on a different chip
 - The resource file now uses English (United States) as the language for all
    files instead of Swedish (Sweden)
 - Better easter egg
 - N163 waves automatically prevent reading from the non-wave registers
Bug Fixes:
 - Fixed NSF export bug for FDS and N163 which use invalid pitch table pointers
 - Fixed NSF export bug for VRC7 where VRC7 channels are two octaves lower
 - Lxx effect no longer affects new notes, only existing notes
