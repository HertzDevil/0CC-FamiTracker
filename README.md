# 0CC-FamiTracker

0CC-FamiTracker is a modified version of FamiTracker that incorporates various
and bug fixes which work in exported NSFs as well. The name "0CC" comes from the
author's favourite arpeggio effect. The current version includes:

 - Complete Sunsoft 5B support
 - Arpeggio schemes
 - Hardware volume envelopes
 - Find / replace tab
 - Detune settings
 - Groove settings
 - Bookmark manager
 - Echo buffer access
 - Delayed channel effects
 - FDS automatic FM effects
 - N163 wave buffer access effect
 - Expansion chip selector & ad-doc multichip NSF export

This program and its source code are licensed under the GNU General Public License Version 2. Differences to the original FamiTracker source are marked with "// // //"; those to the ASM source with ";;; ;; ;" and "; ;; ;;;". The current build is based on the 0.4.6 official release of FamiTracker and an unknown version of the NSF driver used in that release; 0CC-FamiTracker will continue to use that version in future updates unless there is great need for update, but its behaviour may not be identical if and when any of the features of this mod becomes part of the an official FamiTracker release.
